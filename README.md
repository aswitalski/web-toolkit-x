# Web Toolkit X

Web Toolkit X is a lightweight library for building Web user interfaces as a composition of small, self-contained apps. You describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and Toolkit keeps the page in sync with it.

It originates from the Opera Web UI Toolkit.

## In a nutshell

- **Self-contained pieces** - each part of the UI owns its state, styles and behaviour, isolated from the rest of the page, so it can be built, tested and reused on its own.
- **Just JavaScript** - the UI is described with plain data and functions, with no template language to learn and no build step required.
- **Predictable state** - the state changes only in explicit, named steps, and the UI always reflects the current state.
- **Built on the platform** - it relies on what the browser already provides, like Web Components and ES modules, rather than working around it.
- **Mistakes caught early** - types and a debug mode point out errors in the UI while it is being written.
- **Extensible** - plugins add behaviour across all the apps, like logging, shared styles or helper methods, without changing them.

## Usage

```ts
import toolkit, {
  WebComponent,
  type CommandsAPI,
  type Template,
} from 'web-toolkit-x'

type Props = { start: number }
type State = { count: number }

const CounterCommands = {
  increment() {
    this.count += 1
  },
} satisfies CommandsAPI<State>

class Counter extends WebComponent<Props, State, typeof CounterCommands> {
  static elementName = 'my-counter'

  static styles = ['styles/counter.css']

  static commands = CounterCommands

  getInitialState(props: Props): State {
    return { count: props.start }
  }

  render(): Template {
    return [
      'button',
      { onClick: () => this.commands.increment() },
      `Clicked ${this.props.count} times`,
    ]
  }
}

await toolkit.render(Counter, document.body, { start: 0 })
```

The types are optional, the same component works in plain JavaScript without them.

Toolkit is also available as a single script, exposing the `toolkit` global:

```html
<script src="toolkit-0.70.0.js"></script>
```

The global is typed by the `web-toolkit-x/global` declarations, listed in `types` in `tsconfig.json` or referenced in the scripts using it:

```ts
/// <reference types="web-toolkit-x/global" />
```

### Configuration

Toolkit renders without the debug mode and plugins by default. Both can be configured at any time, also after rendering. Options not provided keep their current values. Changed plugins are uninstalled from the created roots and the new ones installed:

```ts
toolkit.configure({ debug: true, plugins: [plugin] })
```

## Components

Web Components render the content of an app, managing its state. Nested Web Components are rendered in their own custom elements.
Their state is created from the props in `getInitialState()` and updated with commands, or by the parent with `getUpdatedState()`.

Components render fragments of a Web Component from props, and pure components are just functions:

```ts
const Square = (props: { color: string; size: number }): Template => [
  'section',
  {
    class: 'square',
    style: {
      backgroundColor: props.color,
      height: [props.size, 'px'],
      width: [props.size, 'px'],
    },
  },
]
```

Both can define the `onCreated()`, `onAttached()`, `onPropsReceived()`, `onUpdated()`, `onDestroyed()` and `onDetached()` lifecycle methods.

Read more about [Bragi templates](BRAGI.md), the [Commands API](COMMANDS.md) and see a few [examples](EXAMPLES.md).

## TypeScript

Components are typed with their props, and their `render()` methods return a `Template`. Templates are type-checked, so misspelled props and attributes, unknown style properties or listeners of wrong event types are reported:

```ts
import { Component, type Template } from 'web-toolkit-x'

class Title extends Component<{ text: string }> {
  render(): Template {
    return ['h1', { class: 'title' }, this.props.text]
  }
}
```

Child templates passed to a component are available as `this.children`:

```ts
class Card extends Component<{ title: string }> {
  render(): Template {
    return ['section', ['h2', this.props.title], ...this.children]
  }
}
```

Web Components take the types of props, state and the Commands API: `WebComponent<Props, State, Commands>`. The Commands API is typed with the state it changes, using `satisfies CommandsAPI<State>`, as in the usage example above.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

It creates in `dist/release`:

- `index.js` - an ES module with type declarations in `index.d.ts`,
- `toolkit-<version>.js` - a single script exposing the `toolkit` global, typed in `global.d.ts`,

both with source maps, and a declaration map leading editors to the TypeScript sources.

`npm run dev` creates the same files in `dist/dev` and builds them again on every change.

## Demo

```sh
npm run demo
```

It builds Toolkit and runs the demo with the ES module build.

## Development

Toolkit requires Node 24, as defined in `.nvmrc`:

```sh
nvm use
npm install
npx playwright install chromium firefox  # once, for running the tests
```
